From the subway *Wandsbeker Chaussee* I went south. *Hammer Str.* was closed because of a construction.

Marienthal is just a residential area, but a better one. There are many restored, beautiful buildings, clean and well maintained. Everything is well secured, alarm systems and warning signs against burglars everywhere. A lot of expensive cars in the driveways. The closer you get to the highway the less nice the houses are.

There are two geometric parks with lakes, in one of which stands the *Husarendenkmal*.

At the highway a huge sound barrier was built, which is very ugly, and loud it is there anyway. Nearby, the Siel was redone, the tubes are huge.

In the *Wandsbeker Geh√∂lz* it is nice and quiet, there are several lakes and many people were around on a Sunday. Along the forest there are many retirement homes.

Near Wandsbek station there is a bizarre traffic control: an underpass for pedestrians, above the tracks of the Deutsche Bahn and above a freeway.
