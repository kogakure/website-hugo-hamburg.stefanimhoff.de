Farmsen-Berne has a lot of *allotment clubs*, north of *Luisenhof* are mostly 3-storey estates, moderately pretty, but mostly quiet.

East of *Strandbad Farmsen* youâ€™ll find mostly single-family homes, well maintained and bourgeois. Even the driveways without a fence are symbolically locked with hanging chains.

Near the retention basin at *Berner Au* there is a lot of forest (*Berner Wald*), beautiful settlements, but also some skyscrapers. The settlement north of Berner Wald is very beautiful and has well-kept houses.

The *Berner Gutspark* is extremly well maintained and the most beautiful park in the entire district. It is suitable for relaxing and reading on the lawn in fine weather. It can be reached in a few minutes from the subway station *Berne*. In the middle of the park is the *Berner Gutshaus*.

The route along the metro line has mostly 3- or 4-story settlements.

There is a lot of green and peacefulness, good jogging trails along *Berner Au*. Many playgrounds, sports fields, adventure playgrounds and construction play grounds.
