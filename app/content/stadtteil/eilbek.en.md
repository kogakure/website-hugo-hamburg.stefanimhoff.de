From the subway station *Wartenau* I went south through the *Conventstraße*.

Through the *Hasselbrookstraße* past the *Fundus Theater* and then south.

Eilbek is intersected by two traffic routes. In the north, the *Wandsbeker Chaussee*, on which there is much traffic and in the south of the tracks of the S-Bahn and trains of the Deutsche Bahn. Nevertheless, it was extremely quiet south of the tracks, except for the wind, I could hear nothing. Eilbek’s flats consist mainly of brick or plaster buildings that were erected after the war, as the *Operation Gomorrah* had destroyed large parts of the district in July 1943. In between, however, there is always a house that has been spared and still has the typical Hamburg fronts with plaster and ornaments.

I walked on *Marienthaler Straße* to the intersection *Hammer Steindamm*, which is probably the center of Eilbek. There are several shops, cafes and the *Hasselbrook* S-Bahn station. Continue on the same street until the district school Hamburg-Mitte. Then again over the tracks and to the north. Past the *Factory Hasselbrook*, a restaurant with a cozy beer garden, which was also filled to the last seat.

At the southern end of the *Jacobipark* stands an old civil protection bunker from 1942, which is currently being rebuilt and where expensive condominiums are being built. The penthouse with over 200 m² is already sold, but there are still apartments with about 125 m² from 540.000 € to get.  The conversion is carried out by a company that specializes in concrete milling, because the bunker currently has no windows.

Continue on the *Hasselbrookstraße* along the *Hasselbrook* school, which is a cultural monument and was built in 1905, through the Ritterstraße and then past the *Friedenskirche Eilbek* (1885).

Then head north over the *Wandsbeker Chaussee*, which has plenty of shops, and a lot of cafes, restaurants and hookah lounges. North I went along the Eilbeker way, then the *Maxstraße* to the south and a while along the *Wandsbeker Chaussee*, through the *Eilbeker Bürgerpark* and then along a park strip to the east to *Peterskampweg*.

From the south I went through the *Jacobipark*, a former cemetery, which is now a park. Some larger graves were preserved as monuments. You can find graves and a family tombs with doctors, mayors or senators. There is a larger pond and a lot of people have grilled in the park, picnics or practiced slackline among the trees. In the north is the Easter church. Unfortunately, the park also seems to be a popular location for drunks who sleep on the benches.

Once again I walked through a residential area in the north and then down the *Hammer Steindamm* and the *Pappelallee* again to the north. There are the huge, modern glass buildings of the professional association for health service and welfare, the AOK headquarters Wandsbek and the employment agency Hamburg-Wandsbek.

Directly at the subway and suburban train station *Wandsbeker Chaussee* is a huge Edeka market, the only major supermarket in Eilbek (apart from a very small Edeka in *Marienthaler street*). Here ended my tour through Eilbek.
