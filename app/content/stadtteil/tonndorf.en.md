In Tonndorf there is the *Bio-Bäckerei Springer* (an organic backery), where it smells fantastic of fresh bread and baked goods. Opposite is alarge office complex where companies like *Stressless* or Otto have offices.

South of *Friedrich-Ebert-Damm* there is a residental area, which is poorly maintained. Everything is overgrown with moss, even the street signs. The properties are often overgrown with green and look neglected. The sidewalks are in bad condition, often difficult to walk properly.

Even further south are mainly industry and commerce properties. Everything is pretty bleak, unkempt and ugly. There are countless properties with industry for car (auto repair, tire trade). And a commercial plot for rail needs.

In the forst between *Rahlau* and *Wandse* it is quiet and beautiful. There is a *concentration camp memorial* for about 500 women of *KZ Drägerwerk*, who where imprisoned here. Serveral women were abused and one killed for allegedly sabotaging property (she had dropped a gas mask).

At the cementery Tonndorf there are very old graves, many for soldiers of the 2nd World War and some large graves for whole families.

South of the tracks are mostly industrial properties (costume rental, car dealers). There is a huge area, which looks like abandoned, and belongs to the Bundeswehr. It is a disposal warehouse and is well secured.

Near the train station Hamburg-Tonndorf is the *Studio Hamburg* and a large shopping center. East of it is again residential area, predominate individual houses, very small, partly timeworn, in between but also well-kept houses and a few new buildings. North of the tracks it looks similar.

At the *Ostender Teich* is an outdoor pool, the gate was open and I could just go in there. There is a small beach and an area where you can swim.

North of the *Wandse* are 3- to 5-storey houses, some very new and extremely pretty. A brand new condominium is currently under construction right next to the forest.

Around the *Pohlmannteiche* are again small gardens, access to the lakes is only possible for owners (*Strandpark Ziegelsee*).
