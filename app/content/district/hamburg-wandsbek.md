In the north of _Wandsbek_ there are many small settlements, which are very pretty, semi-detached, everything is well-kept and clean. You can tell that the Wandsbeker are proud of their district.

Near the _Bundeswehr Hospital_ you will find mostly higher buildings (skyscrapers), some Aldi and Lidl markets. The Bundeswehr Hospital is not accessible to private persons, it is military terrain.

Then walking south again you’ll see many small houses, nice and well maintained, continue over the Friedrich-Ebert-Damm. Past a large REWE market and then the past _Betriebshof Wandsbek_ of the Hochbahn, where huge amounts of buses are parked.

Walk along the _Wandse_ through a park and south to the _Staatsarchiv_, where the original documents on the town’s history and numerous files are kept.

Right next to it is the _Jewish cemetery Wandsbek_ from 1637, closed in 1886, but it can not be entered and is a memorial. On it are nothing but ancient tombstones with Hebrew signs.

Then walk through the _shopping center Quarree_, which is really huge, it stretches over several streets and has bridges between the buildings.

Continue south to _Wandsbeker Marktplatz_, where you can find two lion sculptures. They were originally located at the main entrance of the palace complex of _Heinrich Carl von Schimmelmann_. They are under protection of monuments and are today on the marketplace.

Near the former castle there are many, beautiful, old houses with stucco. The castle itself doesn’t exist no longer, there is today the city administration of Wandsbek.

In Wandsbeker wood is a _Memorial stone for Matthias Claudius_, the most famous Wandsbeker inhabitant. He wrote many poems and directed the newspaper _Wandsbeker Bote_ from 1771-1775.
