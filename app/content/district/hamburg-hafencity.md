From the metro station _Meßberg_ I went over a pedestrian bridge to the south in the _HafenCity_. Strictly speaking, however, the district begins only after _Brooktorkai_ / _Ericus_. Once I passed the _Spiegel-building_ over the _Ericusbrücke_, past _Lohseplatz_, _Koreastraße_ and then _Shanghaiallee_ to the south. East of the road is still heavily built, several commercial and residential buildings are still under construction and not every street is walkable.

I walked through the _Lohsepark_, where there are numerous equipment such as trampolines, seating and play opportunities for children. At the metro station _HafenCity University_ I followed the road to the end. The _Versmannstraße_ is not yet built, getting ahead is impossible. Directly at _Baakenhafen_ arise from 2015/2016 new apartments.

In the metro station _HafenCity University_ I watched the lights and music show, which is played once an hour (always on the hour) between 10 and 18 o’clock. While the light installations on the platform usually change color slowly, a true color blast is fired during the multi-minute classic music show.

Via a bridge I reached the southern part of the _Baakenhafen_ and followed the _Baakenalle_ until it suddenly ended in nothingness. Then I turned around and passed _Zieselpark_. Here you can drive (as long as the apartments are not yet available) on cross-segways or tracked vehicles on an obstacle course through the mud.

I followed the bypass _Versmannstraße_ to the _Elbbrücken_ and then turned around. Also there will be built, the _Quatier Elbbrücken_ will fill the whole _Fleetinsel_ once. In the park _Baakenhöft_ there is a viewing platform, from which one can observe the construction in the _Baakenhafen_.

Past the university along the water and along the _Elbakaden_, then through _Hongkongstraße_ and past the International _Maritime Museum Hamburg_. Here was a huge party sponsored by a beer producer and countless people used the good weather in the many beer tents.

I continued on the _Osakaallee_, followed by _Grasbrookpark_, a play paradise for children, the road _Großer Grassbrook_ to _Strandkai_. Again, it was packed. At _Chicagokai_ the cruise ship _MS Amadea_ (193 meters) was anchored and at the beach harbor, right next to the Unilever building, the _Extreme Sailing Series_ took place. A good dozen catamarans with teams from all over the world were racing here. The races were moderated in English, accompanied by a DJ, filmed by cameras and the racing squads and coaches sat in glass buildings behind the wharf. After a few races I went further north, over the _Marco Polo Terraces_.

Again, it was incredibly crowded, the lines in front of the restaurants and ice cream shops were very long. I walked along the _Dalmannkai_ and made a few more photos and videos of a catamaran race from the feeder _Elbphilharmonie_ and then walked past the Elbphilharmonie and on _Am Kaiserkai_. There are many interesting shops, restaurants and offices along the street and in the squares between the buildings. There is also a senior retirement home called _Elbelysium_. However, I doubt that a place there leads to immortality …

At the _Magellan Terraces_ I turned around and walked right along the _Kaiserkai_. Some of the old cranes were left there. At the _Elbphilharmonie_ I went north across a bridge to the street _Am Sandtorkai_ and followed it for a while. I made a detour over the floating pontoon in the harbor basin, where numerous historic ships form the _Traditionsschiffhafen_ opened in 2008.

{{< image src="district/hafencity-62" alt="Traditionsschiffhafen" width="1000" >}}

I walked along the _Sandtorpark_ and across the _Coffee Plaza_, where a huge coffee bean is a work of art. Then along the _Tokiostraße_ and over the Überseeboulevard. From _Dar-es-Salaam-Platz_, I was once again able to take a look at the _International Maritime Museum Hamburg_ and the huge beer festival.

At the end I went along the street _Brooktorkai_ for a while and then walked over the _Dienerreihe_ and the _Holländisch-Brookfleet-Brücke_, where the _HafenCity_ ends. On _Fleetinsel_ stands the _Wasserschloss_, a restaurant overlooking two Fleets. On the way back to the subway _Meßberg_ I passed by the _Dialog im Dunkeln_, where blind people guide you through an exhibition in completely darkened rooms, and get an insight into a life without sight. There is also _Dialog im Stillen_, an exhibition about Deafness.
