From the main station I went south to the _Deichtorplatz_, past the _Deichtorhallen_ to the _Oberhafen_ and then to the southeast. Directly at the _Oberhafen_ is the _Fruchthof_, here begins the district _Hammerbrook_.

I walked along the water and looked at the floodgate between _Oberhafen_ and _Schleusenkanal_. Unfortunately I could see it only from a distance, because some smartass came up with the great idea to transform the information sign and the best place for a photo into a fenced-in commercial area. I followed the water for a while, until I realized that the huge trading area where only fruit was traded and blocked my way to _Hammerbrook_, extended to _Bille_. So I had to turn around and wander it from the other side.

{{< image src="district/hammerbrook-28" alt="Commercial property at Oberhafen" width="1000" caption="Hammerbrook has predominantly commercial and industrial sites: a large fruit trade at the Oberhafen, only very few apartments, but old factory buildings and large warehouses." >}}

I went down the _Amsinckstraße_, where on one side only huge glass buildings and on the other side the fruit trade was located. On the _Süderstraße_ I went into the huge industrial area, and followed the road _Grüner Deich_ to the _flood basin_ followed. In _Hammerbrook_ many major insurance companies, banks, car dealerships or trading companies have their headquarters.

The city is crossed by several train tracks, both the S-Bahn from the main station to the south, as well as the tracks of the Deutsche Bahn. The tracks run at height on bridges over the city.

There are hardly any houses in _Hammerbrook_, just over 2,000 people live in the large district, most of the houses are in very poor condition and offer little desirable living space.

From the bridges over the _Hochwasserbassin_ you have a fantastic view of the _Berliner Bogen_. Further to the east of _Hammerbrook_ are companies like Stadtreinigung and _SVG-Hamburg Straßenverkehrsgenossenschaft_. There is also an event location, which is located in an old warehouse and can be booked for fashion shoots or the like. If you want to register your car or need a license plate, you will also have to drive to this part of _Hammerbrook_. Around the registration office all sorts of car dealerships, TÜV Hanse, shops for signs or rapid approvals have settled.

I went to the northeastern part of _Hammerbrook_ via the _south channel_. Here is the _Berufliche Schule Recycling- und Umwelttechnik_, which sits in parts in a beautiful old brick building with ornate decorations. At the entrance of the school is a huge robot made of pieces of scrap metal.

I walked the _Wendenstraße_ westwards, on one side of which _Hammerbrook_ lies and on the other side _Borgfelde_. This road I have already partially gone on my tour of _Borgfelde_ along.

On the bank of the _Victoriakais_ (to be seen well from the _Wendenbrücke_) several floating houses (_Floating Homes_) are anchored. Here you can visit the different models before buying such a house.

Over the _Heidenkampsweg_, which one drives along, if one wants to leave Hamburg over the landing bridges or wants to enter I went further west, past the rapid-transit railway station _Hammerbrook_ and then over the _middle channel_ to the north. A modern office building joins the other one here.

I walked down the _Nagelsweg_ to the _middle channel_, where _Circus Roncalli_ had set up camp in a huge square. On the banks of the _central canal_ was _Kai 10_, a floating event location for meetings and celebrations at anchor, a big party was in progress.

I went up the _Högerdamm_, on the left side countless sidings of the main station and a design hotel, on the right side of some of the few, very beautiful, old houses that have survived the bombing. The proximity to the train station unfortunately reduces the condition of the houses, which are not well maintained. I walked under the _Nordkanalbrücke_ along _Repsoldstraße_ and _Rosenallee_, where there are more old, beautiful houses.

{{< image src="district/hammerbrook-60" alt="Car bridge" width="1000" >}}

From there through _Spaldingstraße_ and _Nordkanalstraße_ to the east. Again, one office building after another, some hotels that benefit from their proximity to the station. In addition, a large skateboard system with hall and numerous ramps in the _Spaldingstraße_.

My tour ended on the _Ankelmannsplatz_, directly at the S and U Bahn station _Berliner Tor_, where also the modern glass building _Berliner Bogen_ stands, which with 14,000 square meters glass area largest glass building in Europe.
