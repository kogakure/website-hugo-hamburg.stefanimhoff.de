Eilbek is intersected by two traffic routes. In the north, the _Wandsbeker Chaussee_, on which there is much traffic and in the south of the tracks of the S-Bahn and trains of the Deutsche Bahn. Nevertheless, it is extremely quiet south of the tracks.

Eilbek’s flats consist mainly of brick or plaster buildings that were erected after the war, as the _Operation Gomorrah_ had destroyed large parts of the district in July 1943. In between, however, there is always a house that has been spared and still has the typical Hamburg fronts with plaster and ornaments.

The intersection of _Marienthaler Straße_ and _Hammer Steindamm_ is kind of the center of Eilbek. There are several shops, cafes and the _Hasselbrook_ S-Bahn station.

_Factory Hasselbrook_, a restaurant with a cozy beer garden, was filled to the last seat.

At the southern end of the _Jacobipark_ stands an old civil protection bunker from 1942, which is currently being rebuilt and where expensive condominiums are being built. 

The penthouse with over 200 m² is already sold, but there are still apartments with about 125 m² from 540.000 € to get. The conversion is carried out by a company that specializes in concrete milling, because the bunker currently has no windows.

The _Jacobipark_, a former cemetery, is today a park. Some larger graves were preserved as monuments. You can find graves and a family tombs of doctors, mayors or senators.

There is a larger pond and a the park is regulary used for barbecue, picnics or sport activities.

In the north of _Jacobipark_ is the _Osterkirche_. Unfortunately, the park also seems to be a popular location for drunks who sleep on the benches.

Near the U-Bahn Wandsbeker Chaussee there are some office buildings: Berufsgenossenschaft für Gesundheitsdienst und Wohlfahrtspflege, AOK headquarters Wandsbek and the employment agency Hamburg-Wandsbek.

Directly at the subway station _Wandsbeker Chaussee_ is a huge Edeka market, the only major supermarket in Eilbek (apart from a very small Edeka in _Marienthaler street_).
