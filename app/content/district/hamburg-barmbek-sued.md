Behind the shopping center _Hamburger Meile_ are numerous residential areas. A lot of red brick buildings, but in between older buildings with lots of stucco and decorations.

The _Alter Schützenhof_ (1867), located in a yellow painted building has a quite famous history: It was the pub of the professional criminal _Adolf Petersen_ (_Lord of Barmbeck_) and meeting place for criminals in the early 20th. 

Later, he gave up his pub and devoted himself entirely to safe cracking and raids, which brought him repeatedly prison sentences, even once for 12 years. When he was imprisoned again in 1933, he hanged himself in the cell.
