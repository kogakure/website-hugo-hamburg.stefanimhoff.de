From the underground station _Mundsburg_ I went over the large intersection at the _Mundsburg-Center_. Directly at the intersection is a memorial commemorating the 370 people who died on July 30, 1943 in the bombed Karstadt bunker on Hamburger Straße.

I turned into the residential area behind the _Hamburger Meile_ and went north. A lot of red brick buildings, but in between older buildings with lots of stucco and decorations.

Then walking again to the south and past the _Old Schützenhof_ (1867), in which the professional criminal _Adolf Petersen_ (_Lord of Barmbeck_) in the early 20th century had a pub, which was a meeting place for criminals. Later, he gave up his pub and devoted himself entirely to the safe cracking and his raids, which brought him repeatedly prison prison, even once 12 years. When he was imprisoned again in 1933, he hanged himself in the cell.

Ich bin weiter hinter der Hamburger Meile entlang gegangen, am Bartholomäusbad vorbei.

In the area are very beautiful old buildings with stucco and a lot of jewelry on the facades.

I walked through the Johannes-Prassek-Park near Alster-City and looked from a bridge over the Osterbekkanal to expensive penthouse apartments.

I once looked at the _Alster-City_ from close by and went right next to it through the residential area, which is extremely quiet and idyllic.

I walked past the _district court Hamburg-Barmbek_, back to the north and then on the _Biedermannplatz_ south. Then every now and then to the north and south. At the intersection _Barmbeker Markt_ and _Hamburger Straße_ I went to the _Reesestraße_ north to the canal.

I continued along on the road _Flachsland_, where I could take a look at the _T.R.U.D.E._ (Tief runter unter die Elbe, engl. deep down under the Elbe) on the other side of the canal, which stands in the courtyard of the _Museum für Arbeit_. It is the former largest boring head in the world, with which the tubes of the Elbtunnel were dug. Along the _Bramfelder Straße_ and back to the south, a long time along _Eilbekkanal_ and back to the north.

Past the _Hansa-Kolleg_ and then through a park along the _Wandse_. Once around the huge _Schön-Klinik_, a hospital with 700 beds and 1500 employees, and further north.

Then past the _Monument to the starving Barmbeks and refugees of the French siege of Hamburg_. Finally along the road _Dehnhaide_ to the subway _Dehnhaide_.
