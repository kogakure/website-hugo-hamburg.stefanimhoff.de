My tour through _Hamm_ was the longest I have done so far. _Hamm_ consists of three parts: North, Middle and South. I started my tour at the subway station _Burgstraße_ and first looked at the north.

The majority of _Hamm_ was destroyed by _Operation Gomorrah_ in 1943, so there are only occasionally old-style houses here and there. Besides that there are a lot of brick buildings, but also plastered houses. Many apartments have really small windows and I could often see that the light was switched on during bright daylight.

After walking past the first buildings in the northwest I went through the _Thörls Park_, which for the most part is a long, green strip that runs along the tracks.

{{< image src="district/hamm-12" alt="Scupture" width="1000" height="1334" >}}

From the _Dreifaltigkeitskirche_ I went north and then walked through the _Hammer Park_. In addition to a larger pond, there is also a beautiful flower and hedge garden, a playground, several meadows, a mini golf course and table tennis. Next to the children’s playground is a memorial stone for _Joachim Heinrich Campe_.

Then I went through the residential areas north of the park and through the allotment garden _Hammer Hof_. From there again south to the _Dreifaltigkeitskirche_ with the historic, listed cemetery. In addition to a memorial for the war there is also a memorial for the fallen of the First World War and the _Sieveking Mausoleum_.

{{< image src="district/hamm-34" alt="Dreifaltigkeitskirche with the historic, listed cemetery" width="1000" >}}

I went on through the park south of the _Dreifaltigkeitskirche_ and along the _Hammer Landstraße_ to the subway station _Rauhes Haus_. Continue south and the _Droopweg_ along. Down the _Döhnerstraße_, which did not get its name from the Döner kebab, but from _Friedrich Adolf Döhner_, a merchant and politician. In _Hamm_ live probably quite a lot of Muslims, because I have met a lot of women with headscarves.

Living in _Hamm_ is not for people who need peace, because the noise level, especially along the _Eiffelstraße_ is enormous. In addition, Hamm is right in the approach path of the airport and the jets cross the district very often in fairly low altitude flight.

I walked the residential areas in _Hamm-Mitte_ in a large arc and then went along the _Freibads Aschberg_ south. There is a shelter and the properties of the police dog sports club. South along the _Bille_ there are only large allotment garden areas, as well as on the _Billerhuder Insel_ (which belongs to _Rothenburgsort_). Countless yachts are anchored on the banks here, and families drive their boats around the canals.

On the _Rückerskanal_ I went west, where there are mainly industrial and commercial areas. Further south via the south channel around the pillar decorated with cannons and a golden ship in front of the _Störtebeker-Haus_. Then to the east the _Süderstraße_ along past the _Elbschloss an der Bille_. Along the _Bille_ are some beautiful new buildings with water views.

In the western part of _Hamm-Süd_ there are only commercial areas. Numerous warehouses, printshops, sailing clubs and a huge area of nudist nightclub _Babylon_. From there I went back north, over _south channel_ and _middle channel_, then the _Eiffelstraße_ along. My tour ended again at the subway station _Burgstraße_.
