From the main train station I went past the _Museum für Kunst und Gewerbe_ to the south, through the _Kurt-Schuchermacher-Allee_, past the _Besenbinderhof_ and then the _Norderstraße_ along the tracks of the railway. I passed by the _Agentur für Arbeit_, where there is a huge metal artwork. In the _Kurt Schumacher House_ the SPD Hamburg has its seat, which is located in _St. Georg_ has been the strongest party for years.

Continue through the _Jürgen-W-Scheutzow-Park_ to the S-Bahn station _Berliner Tor_, from where the roof of the _Berliner Bogen_ was visible. I walked between the skyscrapers of the _Hamburger Business Center_ at _Berliner Tor_, where big companies like Siemens, IBM or Commerzbank have their offices.

Past the _Studierendenwerk Hamburg_ and the _Hochschule für Angewandte Wissenschaften Hamburg_ (HAW) and then straight to the southwest to _Lindenstraße_. Already from a distance I could see the minarets of the _Centrum-Mosque_ Hamburg, which were painted in 2009 as part of an art project with green and white hexagons. Continue through the _Böckmannstraße_, past the mosque and into the _Kleine Pulverteich_, where the _Al Nour Mosque_ stands.

_St. Georg_ is a neighborhood of contrasts: only a few meters away from the women's entrance of the mosque are gay and lesbian bars and pubs. The further you move north, the hipper gets the district. In _Steindamm_ there are countless Arabic, Turkish and Indian restaurants; Here you will find the most delicious kebab of the city. But there are also numerous erotic shops, sex clubs, numerous hotels and the cinema _Savoy_, in which many films run in the original language.

_St. Georg_ has some of the most beautiful façades in late-Classicist style, especially around the _Hansaplatz_, _Steinplatz_, _Brennerstraße_ and _Lange Reihe_. From _Hansaplatz_ I went through the _Brennerstraße_, the _Lohmühlenpark_ to the large _Asklepios Klinik St. Georg_. _St. Georg_ owes its name to a leprosy hospital founded in 1194 outside the walls of Hamburg, which was dedicated to _Saint George_. The hospital stays true to this tradition. There are also numerous pens in _St. Georg_, founded by wealthy merchants for the needy. I went over the clinic area to the northwest to the Alster.

From there along the shore, past restaurants and sailing schools to _Hotel Atlantic_. Then the _Holzdamm_ down to the main station. Here you will find _Ohnsorg-Theater_ and _Deutsche Schauspielhaus_. Along the station to the south - here also start the city tours by bus - then through the _Steintorweg_ back to the north.

Around the _Trinity Church_ and the whole street _Koppel_ along. Back through the _Lange Reihe_. Since 1998 it is again chic in _St. Georg_, especially around the _Lange Reihe_, rents have risen sharply. In the street you will find many interesting shops, crafts, art, bars and restaurants.

This is where multicultural diversity is lived out: lesbian and gay couples strolling hand in hand, fully-tattooed-full-bearded fathers with several children, skaters with headphones, heavily veiled Muslim women. Only a _weapons_ that prohibits pistols, knives, baseball bats and pepper spray, suggests that things may not always be peaceful here at night.

Through _Kirchweg_ and _Rostocker Straße_ I went on and past the new _Mariendom_, where a monument to _St. Ansgar_ stands. After a few more streets my tour ended at the subway station _Lohmühlenstraße_.
