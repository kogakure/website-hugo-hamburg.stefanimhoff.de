From _Dammtorbahnhof_ I went along the tracks _Alsterglacis_ down to the Alster and then along the banks of the Outer Alster along. There is an Italian restaurant and two rowing clubs, most of which are built on the water. Past the US consulate that is called inofficially _Little White House at the Alster_. The streets around the consulate are not passable and heavy steel columns and high steel fences prevent uninvited guests from reaching the grounds by car. Moreover, it is constantly guarded by several German police officers.

At Mittelweg I passed by the _Max Planck Institute for Comparative and International Private Law_ and then at the _Garden House Fontenay_, where today the Consulate of Egypt is located.

Through the Fontenay, past the still under construction _The Fontenay Hotel_, which has a wavy shape similar to the _Hamburger Welle_, I went again direction Alster and continue along the shore to the north.

Many houses in Rotherbaum are extremely beautiful and well maintained. In the Milchstraße is the _Villa Beit_, which looks almost like a small castle. There are numerous consulates in this district.

I went further south to the Park Moorweide and around the Hotel Grand Elysée Hamburg.

In Feldbrunnenstrasse there is an extraordinary building: The Chinese Teahouse _Yu Garden_ with the typical curved roof gables, stone lion statues and round gates. From there in a curve back to the south, past the _Museum of Ethnology Hamburg_.

Then I walked past the main building of the _University of Hamburg_ and across _Grindelviertel_ and the university campus. Past the _State and University Library of Hamburg Carl von Ossietzky_, past the _Von-Melle-Park_ and the _Mensa philosopher's tower_.

Back to the south past the _Abaton Cinema_ and then through Grindelallee, passing the police station 17, the _Zoological Museum_ and the _Max Planck Institute for Meteorology_, my tour ended at the Schlump subway station.
