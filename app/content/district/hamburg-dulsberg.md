The buildings in this district are made almost exclusively from red brick from the 20s. Everything was rebuilt, because the district was completely destroyed by _Operation Gomorrah_, a firebomb attack on Hamburg in WW2. 

Dulsberg is exceptionally well connected for its size. There are two subway stations and one suburban train station.

Many Muslims and Africans live here. Dulsberg is one of the poorest districts of Hamburg and had until 2003 the highest crime rate. The residential area is very noisy in some places, since it is intersected by Friedrich-Ebert-Damm and Ring 2. And if you live inside, you can hear noise from football fields.

In Nord-Dulsberg there is an elongated park, which is very beautiful and also quieter, because the houses all around catch the noise.

There is the _Linne-Kampfbahn_, a sports field with a red surface. Next to it is _Sportpark Dulsberg_ (_Olympic base Hamburg_) with the _Beach Center_.
